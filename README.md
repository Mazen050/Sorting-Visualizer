**: About project**

This project is a web-based educational tool that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. The goal is to help students and users understand the step-by-step process of sorting through animations and interactive visualizations.

**Implemented Sorting Algorithms**

1 - Bubble Sort – Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted

2 - Selection Sort – Finds the minimum element in each pass and places it in its correct position

3 - Insertion Sort – Inserts each element into its correct place in a sorted portion of the list

4 - Quick Sort – Uses a pivot to divide and conquer the array efficiently

5 - Merge Sort – Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together

**Programming Language**

Python: Used to implement and handle the logic of sorting algorithms

JavaScript, HTML, CSS: Used to build and design the frontend interface and display animations

The backend communicates with the frontend to show how each algorithm sorts the data

**analysis**

We knew that each method had advantages and disadvantages, and through it we were able to make a comparison between them.

**Summary**

In the end, all sorting methods produce similar results, but each has its own advantages and performs differently depending on the situation and input size.
