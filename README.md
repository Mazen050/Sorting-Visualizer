## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a web-based educational tool designed to help students understand how various sorting algorithms work.  
It provides step-by-step visualizations and interactive controls to observe how data gets sorted through animations.

---

## ðŸ§  Implemented Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort** â€“ Compares and swaps adjacent elements repeatedly.  
- **Selection Sort** â€“ Finds and places the minimum element on each pass.  
- **Insertion Sort** â€“ Inserts each element into its correct position.  
- **Quick Sort** â€“ Uses a pivot to recursively divide and sort the array.  
- **Merge Sort** â€“ Divides the array and merges sorted halves efficiently.  

---

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Implements core sorting logic.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Handles frontend interactions and animations.  
- **HTML & CSS** â€“ Structure and style the visual interface.  

> The frontend communicates with the backend to demonstrate each sorting algorithm in real-time.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis

We compared the algorithms based on time complexity, space complexity, and performance with different input sizes.

### Key Findings:
- Each sorting method has unique advantages and use cases.
- Merge Sort and Quick Sort perform better on large datasets.
- Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort are easier to understand but less efficient.

> Visual comparisons and space complexity charts were included in the original GitHub README.

## âœ… Summary

While all sorting algorithms ultimately sort the data correctly, their performance varies based on input size and structure.  
This project helped us understand those differences through hands-on implementation and visualization.
